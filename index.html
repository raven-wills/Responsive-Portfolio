            <p> I am an anthropologist disguised as a full-stack web developer. Please don't tell anyone. </p>
            <p>When I began studying anthropology, my family suddenly became invested in my future. They'd lovingly ask questions
                like: "Why in the world did you pick anthropolgy?" or "Can you get a job with that?" The answer was simple:
                No. What they didn't understand was how intense my desire was to make a career out of professional people
                watching.
            </p>

            <p>Anthropologists believe that people share wants and needs that transcend cultural divides. I plan to use my knowledge
                of these wants and needs to build tools that deliver on both form and function. It's important to me that
                my projects are inclusive, particularly for the most marginalized in a community.
